Hi! I'm Antonia. :smiley: test

I'm a Computer Science student at Universidad Católica del Uruguay. :nerd_face: 

I'm passionate about designing scalable solutions that address challenges in the real world. My ultimate goal is to craft user experiences that are both empathetic and inclusive, achieved through collaboration with a diverse groupe of people that have a variety of perspectives and backgrounds.
